## [!] THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS [!]
The current version available on Firefox Add-ons is v1.4, it is a version writted by [@Grub4K](https://github.com/grub4k).<br />
However due to some bugs within these versions ([archive/Manifest-V2](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/IS.Bookmarks/tree/archive/Manifest-V2), [archive/Manifest-V3](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/IS.Bookmarks/tree/archive/Manifest-V3)), and the complexcity of the code to me; I have decided to re-write it entierely to something simpler.<br />

This new v1.5, will be released publicly as soon as Firefox fix their [background page bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851373) introduced in v117.0

## [WAIT] Before releasing v1.5:
```
- Not my fault but after 30 seconds of execution, the background.js stops on Firefox (it's a FF bug)
  This can eventually be fixed using: https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/229#issuecomment-1705718886
```

## [TODO]:
```
- Make "Tutorial.html" text fit better all together, cuz rn it's ugly.
- Add status of the script if it's working or not visible on the extension's icon. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Badging_API
- Add Chrome, Opera, Edge browsers support.
```
